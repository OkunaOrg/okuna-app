# Important!

**Please do not edit these files directly!** If you're a translator and want to help translate Openspace into other languages, please head over to our [project on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/openspace).

If you're a developer or you just want to change a source string, make sure to do that in the `lib/services/localization.dart` file and then run `make generate_locale`.

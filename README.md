#### Git commit message conventions

Help us keep the repository history consistent üôè!

We use [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) as our git message convention.

If you're using git in your command line, you can download the handy tool [gitmoji-cli](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji-cli).

## Getting started

### 1. Install the `okuna-api` backend.

Follow the [instructions here](https://github.com/OkunaOrg/okuna-api#getting-started) and make sure the server is running.

### 2. Install Flutter

Visit the [Flutter Install website](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install) and follow instructions.

Once you're done, make sure everything works properly by running `flutter doctor`.

````sh
flutter doctor
````

### 3. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone git@github.com:OkunaOrg/okuna-app.git
cd okuna-app
```

### 4. Create the `env.json` file

We use a `.env.json` file to pass environment variables to the application such as the backend endpoint.

Create a copy of `.sample.env.json` named `.env.json`

````bash
cp .sample.env.json .env.json
````

Edit the `.env.json` file  with your environment settings.

````json
{
   "API_URL": "<MANDATORY: The url of the okuna-api backend>",
   "MAGIC_HEADER_NAME" : "<OPTIONAL: The name of a header to append on every request used for access-control.",
   "MAGIC_HEADER_VALUE" : "<OPTIONAL: The value of the header to append on every request used for access-control.>"
}
````

### 5. Configure a signing key
_(Android only step)_

**Create a keystore**

If you have an existing keystore, skip to the next step. If not, create one by running the following at the command line: 

````bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/key.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias key
````

**Note:** keytool might not be in your path. It is part of the Java JDK, which is installed as part of Android Studio. For the concrete path, run flutter doctor -v and see the path printed after ‚ÄòJava binary at:‚Äô, and then use that fully qualified path replacing java with keytool.

**Reference the keystore from the app**

Create a file named <app dir>/android/key.properties that contains a reference to your keystore:

````properties
storePassword=<password from previous step>
keyPassword=<password from previous step>
keyAlias=key
storeFile=<location of the key store file, e.g. /Users/<user name>/key.jks>
````

**Note:** Although the file <app dir>/android/key.properties is ignored, make double sure the file remains private; do not check it into public source control.

### 6. Open the iOS/Android simulator or connect a device.

**iOS Simulator**

1. Launch Xcode

2. Click on the XCode top left menu item (Next to the Apple logo)

3. Open Developer Tool -> iOS Simulator

**Android Simulator**

1. Launch Android Studio

2. Select Tools -> AVD Manager

3. If no virtual device available, click Create Virtual Device and follow steps.

4. Select the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è icon next to the device to run.

**Connect a device**

1. Plug the device

2. Allow any permission request shown in the device

### 7. Run the flutter app

**Note**: We use [flavors](https://medium.com/@salvatoregiordanoo/flavoring-flutter-392aaa875f36) to configure different names and settings for different environments.

**Development flavor**

````bash
flutter run --flavor development
````

**Production flavor**

````bash
flutter run --flavor production
````

**Profile**

Not a flavor but Flutter's way to profile the app. [Read more here](https://flutter.io/docs/testing/ui-performance).

````bash
flutter run --profile
````

### 7.b Adding new Locale strings

1. Add localization string get method to `openbook_app/lib/services/localizations.dart`
2. Run `make generate_locale`
3. Upload assets/i18n/en folder's contents to https://crowdin.com/project/okuna/settings#files by pressing `Update` next to the existing files.
4. Apply the translations on crowdin, then build and download
5. Copy the contents of the downloaded archive to assets/i18n 
6. Run `make build_locale`

### 7.c Localized Locales
At Okuna, we wanted to support different combinations of languages and country codes. For eg.
Someone could want Brazilian Portugese as their language but choose country Netherlands since they live there. The country could be relevant
for location relevant content, payments etc. while the language is just what the user prefers.

Most locale frameworks only allow locale `pt,BR` which means Brazilian portuguese but this also sets the country code in the locale
object to Brazil which may not always be the case.

Therefore, localized locales are locales that have a language code that looks like this for eg. `pt-BR` and in addition also a country code. Which makes the locale object
`Locale('pt-BR', 'BR);` Our API supports many such languages which have different localized versions and we can add new languages as required.
 

While looking for loading locale files when a locale change takes place, the `intl` library converts a locale to a canonical name where dashes in language codes become underscores.
The canonical names for `Locale('nl','NL')` would be `nl_NL`, ie `languageCode_countryCode`. The `intl` package, first looks for if a language
exists with that and if not found, next splits this on the underscore and looks for `nl`.

With our custom localizedLocales, `intl` library converts this to `pt_BR_BR`. This confuses the `intl` package as the language is stored with it as `pt_BR`. 
(See method `__findExact` in the auto-generated file `messages_all.dart` for in-depth code) . To deal with locale changes, we maintain a `localizedLocales` list in the `localization.dart` service which tells the 
localization service to only pass along `pt_BR`to `intl` when it encounters a localizedLocale. This ensures it finds the right match and loads the locale.

In addition,a small note, we convert the `Accept-language` header in `httpie.dart` to lowercase since django expects it like that and this header is case sensitive. So django will not recognise
`pt-BR` but recognises `pt-br`. 

## To onboard a new language

1. Create a folder in i18n with the localized language code, for.eg `pt-BR` and store the arb files there.
2. Add the localized locale in lib/translation/constants.dart
3. If the language code contains 2 parts (e.g. language_country), add the localized locale code to the `localizedLocales` list in `localization.dart`.
4. If the language code contains 2 parts (e.g. language_country), create a `lang_country_localization_delegate.dart`. See `lib/delegates/pt_br_material_localizations.dart` for example.
4.2 Add the delegate in the main.dart file
5. Run `make build_locale` as is standard. 

### 8. Contribute! 

Help us keep Okuna going! Please look into our open issues. All contribution, no matter how small, makes a big difference.

### 9. Build for production

To build the android APK

```flutter build appbundle --target-platform android-arm,android-arm64```

To build the iOS archive

```flutter build ios```

## Official workaround's list

Unfortunately, Flutter is still in its early steps as a framework and ecosystem.

Workarounds to get the app to work are something we see frequently.

This is the section where we'll be documenting the workarounds to avoid confusion in the future.

### OneSignal iOS Build Failing

The [OneSignal Flutter SDK](https://github.com/OneSignal/OneSignal-Flutter-SDK) does not work out of the box.

In Android, the SDK Setup Guide contains wrong instructions which were addressed on [this Github Issue](https://github.com/OneSignal/OneSignal-Flutter-SDK/issues/56).

In iOS, there was no official solution to it and the fix was an absolute "hack".

The original issue for the build error is [this one](https://github.com/OneSignal/OneSignal-Flutter-SDK/issues/57) and the "hack" we implemented is found in [this issue](https://github.com/OneSignal/OneSignal-Flutter-SDK/issues/42#issuecomment-459476383) plus [disabling bitcode](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50553443/xcode-ios-build-linker-command-failed-with-exit-code) in the service extension.
